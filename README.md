# Agentic SDLC — LambdaTest

> Requirements go in. **KaneAI authors the tests.** HyperExecute runs them. AI explains failures. Objectives auto-improve every run.

---

## What this is

A fully automated testing pipeline where **KaneAI** — LambdaTest's AI browser agent — authors every test case from a plain-English objective. No selectors. No scripts. No page objects.

You give KaneAI an objective:

> *"Login to saucedemo as standard_user with password secret_sauce, click the Add to cart button for Sauce Labs Backpack, and verify the cart badge shows 1."*

KaneAI opens a real browser, figures out the UI, executes the steps, and saves the verified test directly into LambdaTest Test Manager. HyperExecute runs it in parallel. If it fails, Claude explains why and rewrites the objective — automatically, before the next run.

On the **next push**, the pipeline starts from the improved objectives automatically.

---

## Triggers

| How | What happens |
|-----|-------------|
| **Push to `main`** (`ci/`, `requirements/`, `hyperexecute.yaml`) | Pipeline auto-runs using committed `objectives.json` |
| **Manual dispatch — no URL** | Same as push — uses committed `objectives.json` |
| **Manual dispatch + requirements URL** | Downloads doc → Claude extracts ACs → Claude generates objectives → full pipeline |

> Auto-improve commits use `[skip ci]` so they don't re-trigger the pipeline.

---

## Stage-by-stage

### Stage 1 — Requirements Analysis *(only when a requirements URL is provided)*

Claude reads the document and extracts Acceptance Criteria.

**Supported URL formats:**

| Source | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Google Docs | `docs.google.com/document/d/<ID>/edit` |
| Google Drive | `drive.google.com/file/d/<ID>/view` |
| GitHub file | `github.com/user/repo/blob/main/reqs.md` |
| GitHub Gist | `gist.github.com/user/<ID>` |
| Any raw URL | `https://example.com/requirements.txt` |

All formats are auto-detected. Make the doc publicly accessible before running.

**Output:** `requirements/analyzed_requirements.json`

---

### Stage 2 — Objective Generation *(only when a requirements URL is provided)*

Claude generates up to 5 crisp, intent-based objectives from the extracted ACs.

**Format enforced (strictly):**
```
Login to <url> as <user> with password <pass>, <one physical action>, and verify <one immediately visible result>.
```

**Good:**
```
Login to https://www.saucedemo.com/ as standard_user with password secret_sauce,
click the Add to cart button for Sauce Labs Backpack, and verify the cart badge shows 1.
```

**Bad (never do this):**
```
# Multiple actions chained
add Sauce Labs Backpack to the cart and navigate to the cart page, and verify...

# State transition (timing-sensitive)
...and verify the button changes to 'Remove'.

# Step-by-step micro-instructions
Navigate to the URL, type 'standard_user' into the username field, click the Login button...
```

**Output:** `ci/objectives.json` — committed to the repo for reuse across runs.

---

### Stage 3 — KaneAI Authoring *(Phase 1)*

`kane-cli run` executes each objective on a real browser. KaneAI uses AI vision — no pre-written selectors. Each verified test is saved into LambdaTest Test Manager.

- **3 SCs run in parallel** (staggered 3s apart)
- **600s timeout per SC**
- **Reuse check:** if objective is unchanged and a valid TM test case exists from a previous run, kane-cli is skipped (saves time)
- **Tier 1 — Infra retry:** transient failures (CDP disconnect, browser crash) → retry same objective immediately
- **Tier 2 — Inline self-heal:** logic failure → Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) rewrites objective on-the-fly → immediate retry in the same run
- **Cross-run self-heal:** at the start of every run, Claude pre-heals any objectives that failed the previous run (uses LT AI RCA as context for HE failures)

---

### Stage 4 — Test Run + HyperExecute *(Phases 2 & 3)*

Creates a LambdaTest Test Manager test run, links all authored test cases, and triggers HyperExecute.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Environment | Configurable via `TM_ENVIRONMENT_ID` (default: Win10, Firefox, desktop) |
| Concurrency | 5 parallel VMs |
| Retry on failure | 1 retry |

The pipeline polls HyperExecute until all sessions reach a final state before proceeding.

---

### Stage 5 — Root Cause Analysis

Two-layer RCA for every failed scenario:

**Layer 1 — LT AI RCA:**
- Waits 120s after HE completion for the LT insights engine to index sessions
- Triggers `POST /insights/api/v3/public/rca/generate` for the HE job
- Retries trigger up to 3× with 60s gaps if `triggered=0` (indexing lag)
- After trigger, waits 90s for generation then fetches via `GET /rca?job_ids=...`
- Retries fetch up to 3× with 30s gaps if no entries returned yet

**Layer 2 — Claude RCA fallback** (when LT AI RCA is unavailable):
- Reads kane-cli `failure_detail` from `run_history.json`
- Generates structured analysis: what was asked, what kane-cli did, what needs fixing
- Marked as `source: claude-fallback` — never shown in the main traceability table

**Output:** `ci/rca_results.json`

---

### Stage 6 — Traceability Matrix

Full matrix linking every result back to its origin — appears in GitHub Step Summary after every run.

```
AC → Objective → SC → TM Test Case → Authoring result → HE Execution result → AI RCA
```

Columns:
- **Authoring** — did kane-cli successfully author the test? (Phase 1)
- **Execution** — did HyperExecute pass the test? (Phase 3)
- **RCA** — LT AI RCA only; blank for claude-fallback entries

---

### Stage 7 — Auto-Improve *(end of every run)*

After HE results and RCA are in, Claude rewrites objectives for **all failed SCs**:

- Phase 1 authoring failure → uses kane-cli run summary
- HE execution failure → uses LT AI RCA text as healing context
- Applies the same strict rules: 1 action, 1 immediately-visible assertion, no "changes to"

The improved `objectives.json` is committed with `[skip ci]`. The next push starts from better objectives automatically.

> Custom URL runs (`REQUIREMENTS_URL` set) never overwrite the committed saucedemo objectives — only default runs auto-improve.

## Forking this repo

### 1. GitHub Secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets**

| Secret | Description | Where to get it |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `LT_USERNAME` | LambdaTest username | [accounts.lambdatest.com/security](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security) |
| `LT_ACCESS_KEY` | LambdaTest access key | [accounts.lambdatest.com/security](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API key | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

### 2. GitHub Variables

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**

| Variable | Description | How to find it |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `TM_PROJECT_ID` | Test Manager project ID (ULID) | KaneAI → your project → URL contains the project ID |
| `TM_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | Test environment ID (integer) | Test Manager → Environments → create or select → ID in API response |

If these variables are not set, the pipeline falls back to the default saucedemo project and environment.

### 3. Configure kane-cli for your project

```bash
kane-cli login --username $LT_USERNAME --access-key $LT_ACCESS_KEY
kane-cli config project YOUR_TM_PROJECT_ID
kane-cli config folder  YOUR_TM_FOLDER_ID   # optional: scope to a folder
```

Update the `kane-cli config project` step in `.github/workflows/flow2.yml` with your project ID.

### 4. Update objectives

Replace `ci/objectives.json` with objectives for your app:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "SC-001",
    "ac_id": "AC-001",
    "name": "SC-001: short description",
    "objective": "Login to https://yourapp.com as user with password pass, click <one thing>, and verify <one immediately visible result>."
  }
]
```

Or trigger a manual dispatch with a `requirements_url` to generate objectives automatically from your requirements doc.

### 5. Push

```bash
git push origin main
```

Watch the run at **Actions → Agentic SDLC — KaneAI Pipeline**.

## Edge cases

| Situation | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| SC fails authoring | Infra retry first; then inline Claude heal + retry; cross-run heal on next push |
| All SCs fail Phase 1 | Pipeline aborts before creating HE job |
| Phase 2 returns no TC IDs | HE poll skipped immediately (no 30-min timeout) |
| LT AI RCA `triggered=0` | Retries trigger 3× (60s apart); Claude fallback for Phase 1 authoring failures only |
| RCA session returns 404 | Skipped instantly — no retry loop |
| HE session status `completed` | Treated as in-progress retry (not passed) — waits for final result |
| Auto-improve commit | `[skip ci]` prevents re-triggering the pipeline |
| Custom URL run | Objectives generated for that URL; never overwrites default saucedemo objectives |
| First run (no history) | Cross-run heal skips gracefully — nothing to heal |
| Private Google Doc URL | Download fails — make the doc public ("Anyone with link can view") |
